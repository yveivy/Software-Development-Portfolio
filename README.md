## Software Developer Portfolio

## Description

Hello and welcome to my project portfolio! My name is Yve, and I am actively working to become a Rock Star software developer. So take a chance and hire me. Or don't, either way I'm still going to grind because I love coding and want to get better every day. But just know, that eventually your competitor is going to notice me, and you'll wish you'd made me an offer today.
