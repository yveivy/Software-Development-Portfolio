                    <p class="content content-4"> Dedicated to the principle of continuous learning, I am a full stack developer with a strong enthusiasm for JavaScript, React, and all facets of web development. I am thrilled by the limitless potential and power to create, and I am excited to provide innovative solutions that help people interact with technology every day. Recently, I completed an intensive program at UT Austin, where I excelled in a challenging curriculum, sharpening my skills in software design and development.

                    In addition to my technical background, I bring extensive experience in sales and project management within the software industry. My sales experience has equipped me with the ability to understand client needs and deliver tailored solutions, while my project management skills ensure that projects are completed on time and within budget. This unique blend of skills allows me to bridge the gap between technical teams and clients effectively.
                        
                    I am also passionate about artificial intelligence. I freelance with data annotation, training language models, and have utilized AI in my software projects to drive processes and create unique user experiences. This has given me a deep appreciation for the transformative potential of AI in the tech industry.
                        
                    I am eager to leverage my diverse skill set in either a software design role or a sales and project management position within the software industry. I am ready to make my personal mark and contribute to innovative projects that make a difference. </p>
